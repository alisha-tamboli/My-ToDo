Q1.
Division Barrier
medium
Abhilash went to the streets of Chandigarh and bought a list of integers called "nums" and another integer called "barrier". His task is to find the smallest integer called "divisor" such that when he divides each number in the list "nums" by the divisor and rounds up to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element(explained in below example), the sum of all the rounded divisions is less than or equal to the barrier. Note Each result of the division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element. (For example:- 7/3 = 3 and 20/10 = 2). The test cases are generated so that there will be an answer.

Q4.
Maximum Vowels in a Substring
medium
In the magical land of Alphabeta, words possess mystical powers. Among these words, the potency is linked to the count of special letters, akin to vowels in English: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. Your task is to aid the wizards of Alphabeta in maximizing the power of words. Given a string and a specified length for substrings, you are to determine the maximum number of special letters within a substring of that length.

Q6.
The Number of Good Substrings
hard
You are given an integer array nums. We call a subset of nums good if its product can be represented as a product of one or more distinct prime numbers. 1) For example, if nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]: a) [2, 3], [1, 2, 3], and [1, 3] are good subsets with products 6 = 2*3, 6 = 2*3, and 3 = 3 respectively. b) [1, 4] and [4] are not good subsets with products 4 = 2*2 and 4 = 2*2 respectively. Determine the number of different good subsets in nums modulo 109 + 7. A subset of nums is any array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) elements from nums. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.
